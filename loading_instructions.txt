Enter python within an appropriate Anaconda Environment

import mne

annotations can be loaded with the following command:
annotations = mne.read_annotations(annotation_filename)

load a raw file
raw = mne.io.Raw(raw_filename)
if it's still in brainvision format
raw = mne.io.read_raw_brainvision(raw_brainvision.vhdr)

you can set the annotations for a raw object as follows
raw.set_annotations(annotations)

you can combine multiple annotations into one simply by adding them
new_annots = annot1 + annot2 + annot3
